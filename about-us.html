        <h2 style="text-align: center;">About Temperature Sensors and Controllers Distributor</h2>
        <p>Established in 1965, Testemp was created to manufacture temperature sensors specifically for the growing plastics and rubber industries.</p>
        <p>The company quickly expanded to manufacturing analogue power and temperature controllers (Testemp Electronics).</p>
        <p>Alongside Testemp's own range of temperature controllers, was the growing range from our Japanese supplier Shinko Technos. With a worldwide distribution of agents Testemp established themselves as a loyal reseller of their range that now exceeds 40 years.
        Over this period, Testemp has distributed a wide range of analogue and digital temperature controllers and temperature sensors.</p>
        <p>Many of these units are now obsolete but can easily be updated with the current models detailed in the controller section of our website.</p>
        <p>As Testemp has grown it has expanded its range of products into other industrial areas.</p>
        <p>In 2006 as Shinko decreased its production of analogue controllers, Testemp established that there was still a wide market for the basic dial analogue controller and became a UK distributor for Brainchild’s range. Concentrating in two products in particular, the BTC-901 and BTC-404 have grown to become regular products to a wide variety of industries.</p>
        <p>As markets grow and change, Testemp is keen to explore new areas and develop products to meet new applications.</p>
